Will eventually end up on my website http://surf.to/muguk

For use with Hugo v1.27 or higher as from v1.27 onwards, there was the
inclusion of the relative search method .. so lots more games were
added to this file as well as a few extra cheats added to ones from 
the 0.4 version of this file!!

If you want to send me your cheats for inclusion, full credits will be
listed for each cheat.

General Info:-

Load in Hugo and load in the ROM.  I have assumed you will be using all
ROMS which are NOT known as bad-dumps, bit-flipped, different sizes etc.

If you are not sure then use GoodPCE first to rename the ROM before expecting
my POKEs to work.  

For a normal refresh value, hit F2, type in the Offset and then the value
according to my chart.

For infinite (ie. frozen) values, hit F3 and then do the same.

I only spent a few hours a day doing these cheats.  

Is there anyone else out there doing some of their own - or am I on my own
as per the Sega Master System, Gamegear and SC/SG machines?  If you do your
own, then get in touch as I'd hate to duplicate your work.

I regularly train SMS/GG ROMs as well as normal PC games.  Occasionally I 
will also attempt to train any Atari ST games I am asked to do (which is
how I started out game hacking .. http://come.to/muguk!)
