 * Q * What the heck is a Pc engine ?

 * A * It's a 8/16 bits game console made by Nec. It's between the years
       1985 and 1992 that it knew its main success. Mostly known in Japan,
       it was also imported in the states under the name of TurboGraphX 16.
       In Europe, it was known in France and English (at least, but not only)
       under the name of CoreGraphX.
       Predilection games for this machine were shoot'em up and RPG.
       By the way, since it was the first console to be able to use a CD rom
       drive, its CD RPG were considered (and still are) among the best
       console RPG.
       If I'm not wrong, it has been taken over by TTI after NEC (TTI must
       be a branch of NEC). Their policy toward emulation is very nice, I've
       never heard of any troubles with rom spreading nor emulator authors.
       The latest official game to have appeared on it were 'Brain of the
       Dead 1 & 2' in June 1999. It's an older game that finished to be
       ported.
       Some of the most known games (just a few, there are a tons) are :
         DraculaX, Sapphire, PC kid serie , Neutopia, gunhed serie (super
         star soldier, soldier blade, final soldier), Bomberman serie,
         Far east of eden serie ...
       The scene around this console is made of fans, since there's no more
       commercial interests around it. It appears to be a console with a lot
       of true fans around it since I often see or hear people that wanted to
       decicate a web site to it because it was their favorite, because they
       think it needs to be known more. I haven't find such an enthousiasm
       with other machine (but I admit I'm not objective).
       As for the developpement scene, it seemed to be quite active until
       middle 1998 (with GREAT development kit from David Michel, Magic kit)
       and looked like it was slowing down (not to say it was stopping). But
       the Hu6280 team showed us it was possible to make a little game for it
       [jamanoid]. Let's hope we'll see some new stuff arriving in it to
       make it start anew, once done, it's little a vicious cercle, but in
       the good sense :)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * What is a command line ?

 * A * This is simply what you write after the name of the executable.
       Clicking on the file under Windows or similar thing generally doesn't
       allow you to enter any argument for the executable.
       You can either use the 'properties' to specify constant parameters,
       drag'n drop a file to the executable icon to make the name of the
       first file the first argument of the executable, or launch it using
       DOS prompt and write down additional parameters after the name of the
       executable.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * What is this .INI file ?

 * A * It's a human readable file containing informations on default behaviour
       of Hu-Go!. e.g. default video mode, default directory for roms, etc...

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How can I change a variable in the .INI file ?

 * A * Open the Hu-Go!.INI file in any text editor, like NotePad or Edit, and
       search for the name of the variable to change. Once found, change
       the value at the right side of the '='. If the variable name
       doesn't exist, just write it in the [main] section (i.e. after the [main]
       text and before any other [???] declaration) followed by the sign '='
       and the new value.

       For example, let's say that we had a sound option (we do have one), and
       wanted to change it. The options are '0' for nosound, and '-1' for
       autodetect sound. If in the .INI file the option looks like this:

            smode = 0

       Then there will be no sound. If you would like to enable sound, then
       simply change the text to read:

            smode = -1

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Generally, where can I change an option ?

 * A * If the option is specific to .INI file or command line, you don't have
       the choice but else, if it's just as a test, you can specify it on
       command line since it will then override the .INI file option. But
       if you don't want to write in down each time, you can change the value
       in the .INI file.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How do I use a game pad ?

 * A * If you want to quickly use one, just change the 'config' variable in
       the .INI file to 1. This is a sample example for how to use a joypad
       for first player with 'space' and 'enter' key as select and start.
       For more precise control definition, see later...

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * What game pads are supported ?

 * A * All whose that allegro can handle. i.e. all which comply with the
       normal game pad interface and some more. Currently, special joystick
       supported are :
        - CH Flightstick Pro
        - Logitech Wingman Extreme or Thrustmaster Mk.I compatible
        - SideWinder
        - Gravis Gamepad pro
        - Pad SNES on LTP1,2 or 3
        - Wingman Warrior

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * What is a rom ?

 * A * First, you must know that a classic console cartridge contains data
       that the console will execute. That's the way you can play video games.
       These data is actually a series of '0' and '1' engraved in
       a cartridge. And a rom is simply the same serie of '0' and '1'
       but 'engraved', saved in fact, in a plain file. This file will then
       be readable by an emulator that will read data in it exactly the same
       way the console read data from the true cartridge, so that you can play
       console games on your PC without trying to insert true cartridges into
       your floppy disk ^_^

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * What is an iso ?

 * A * Basically it's the same thing as a rom (see above) but instead of using
       data on a cartridge, data is contained on a data track on a CD. That's
       why iso can be so large. To make a large size cartridge game is
       expensive for developers, so they try to keep the file size small.
       To make a large size CD game cosrs the same as a small size CD game,
       and that is one reason that ISO files are so huge.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How can I play a PC Engine CD I'm used to play with my Duo (e.g.) ?

 * A * You have to launch Hu-Go! with '-c1' command line parameter,
       Then Hu-Go! should boot on the CD inserted in the first CD rom drive
       or the specified one with '-i?' option on the command line.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Why my CD doesn't run under MS-Windows but plain DOS ?

 * A * Post your question to Bill Gates and ask him why MS-Windows isn't
       compatible with DOS. =)
       Seriously, this is MS-Windows fault. It doesn't like the fact that a
       code track is situated at second place.
       More precisely, it's MSCDEX driver fault.
       Now this the new ASPI driver, you can play cds under windows

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * My monitor display weird thing, what to do ?

 * A * Try another default video mode, e.g. '-v4' on command line should
       do the trick, or you can change the video option in the .INI file.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * What is an cd system card ?

 * A * This is a rom containing the code compulsory to boot a CD and play CD
       games. You'll also need it for ISO files.
       There are two kinds of cd system card, the usual one from Nec (most
       games use it) and Game Express one (very few game use it).
       The Nec one exist in several versions : 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0
       With the 3.0, you should be able to run almost all CD games.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How do I turn off sound ?

 * A * Either putting '-s0' in command line or setting variable 'smode' to '0'
       in .INI file.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Is there any available front-end for Hu-Go! ?

 * A * Yes. House Atreide's Front End can be found on
       www.emulfr.org/atreides. (URL is no more correct I fear)
       But it's in french and need VB6 runtimes.

       There's also Eagan's frontend. the author of this frontend also has a
       Keith Courage in alpha zone Turbo Graphx to PC conversion project.
       You can find out all about it at :
       www.angelfire.com/ca2/eagsproging

       Now, I've made mine. You can grab it on Hu-Go! page (www.hugo.fr.fm).
       It's in the miscelaneous page...

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Hu-Go! is too slow, how can I speed it up ?

 * A * There are some little tings you can try :

       - Try the '-v4' switch on the command line. In 320*200 mode you will get
       about 10% more speed but (there's always a "but") the screen will be
       clipped (i.e. you won't be able to see the first and last 12 lines).

       - If you usually play under WIN9X, try to play under plain DOS, you
       may gain about 15% extra speed.

       - Disable sound with the '-s0' command line switch or by putting "sound=0"
       in the .INI file.

       - Disable EAGLE mode with the -e0 command line switch or by putting
       eagle=0 in the .INI file.

       - Don't forget you have a skip frame option using '+' and '-'. Things
       become less smooth but a lot faster (up to 16 times).

       - If your hard disk keeps on accesing data while playing, it means you
       don't have enough RAM and it is using virtual memory on disk (which is
       a lot slower). You should try to make a 'clean' boot without any
       drivers etc. loaded.

       If this is still not enough then the only option is to buy more RAM (I
       don't think you would ever have to do this, Hu-Go! is very economic ;)

       - Buy a faster computer ;)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Hu-Go! is too fast, how can I slow down things ?

 * A * Try enabling synchronisation using F10. This should reduce fps
       to 60.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Why are there some bunch of digits sometimes ?

 * A * This is the debugger mode which allow you to investigate rom or iso.
       You may have pressed '*' on digit pad, then simply press it one more
       time to go back to emulation.
       But just before a crash, this mode is automaticaly enabled. You can
       exit it the same way but the emulator will quit automaticaly then.
       Please report me (Zeograd@caramail.com) such problem with roms.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Can I play all games with Hu-Go! ?

 * A * Unfortunately, no.
       On Hu-Card (normal rom), you can expect a 90-95% compatibility even if
       some people tell me much less.
       With ISO files, you can count on a 85% compatibility. You can check
       the compatibility list at
       hugo.consolemul.com/hugo_en.htm#comp_list to see what ISO are emulated
       and what aren't.
       CD and ISO compatibility are almost the same, but you can get some CD
       working even if ISO isn't.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Where can I find roms and ISOs ?

 * A * Theoricaly, you can't get roms or ISOs of games you don't own the
       right to use it. But since it's very hard to make roms from cardridges,
       there are some sites where you can pick up the ones you're allowed to.
       It's rather the same thing with ISOs. Apart the fact it's easier to
       make them using some utilities you can found on my page :
       www.hugo.fr.fm
       Else ISO/rom sites are mainly :
       www.fagemul.fr.fm
       www.nec-ro-pole.fr.fm
       ...

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * What is 'scancode.txt' ?

 * A * It's used with the key redefinition.
       Each key on your keyboard got a low level code called scancode.
       It's used to represent the key.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How to become a beta tester ?

 * A * Be motivated and ask me to (zeograd@caramail.com)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * Can I help in any maneer, and if so, how ?

 * A * Sure, you can help. They are very different way to do so.
       As a coder, you can help adding some features ( front end,
       installation proggy).
       As a graphics artist, you can make banner, or background, icons, etc...
       If you are generous, you can send CDs, or even some hardware, who knows =)
       Or else you can just send a nice word to motive me ^_^
       If all case, either send me a messy to zeograd@caramail.com or
       contact me via ICQ (UIN : 40632933)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * I'd like to port it to another platform, how can I do ?

 * A * First, the best thing to do is telling me about it so that we can
       chat about it. Then just hand over the latest available sources
       and go for it. Never hesitate to mail me so that I both know where
       is the project and I may be able to give advice.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * I've seen bugs or problems in the emu, how can I report it ?

 * A * Depending of the 'gravity' of the trouble, either post in the forum
       available on my page (www.hugo.fr.fm) or directly send me a mail at
       zeograd@caramail.com

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * I'm a webmaster, how can I help ?

 * A * You can make a mirror of my site, just ask for me so that I can tell
       you when I make an update.
       Or you can use one of the nice banners to link to the main page or to
       the local copy of a Hu-Go! archive. The banners can be found at
       hugo.consolemul.com/misc_en.htm#banner

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How much does Hu-Go! cost ?

 * A * Errr... Nothing. Well almost. In all cases, no money. But any feedback
       or help is greatly appreciated. In all cases, there's nothing
       compulsory.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How can I make a PC Engine game ?

 * A * Look out for Magic Kit (made by David Michel) and some knowledge for
       PC Engine hardware and software. You can also hand over a nice open
       source PC Engine game at David Shadoff's homepage (www.interlog.com/~daves)
       as well as other stuff needed to make a game.
       You can also grab HuC, our C compiler for pc engine that you should
       find on Utopia team site (http://utopia.consolemul.com)
       Then you can use the debugging abilities of Hu-Go! to make your game
       working perfectly.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Q * How can I expect in term of speed on my machine ?

 * A * It depends on lots of thing (sound, eagle mode, played game, OS)
       but we can give an idea using the following array :

 * Q * How can I change the key setting ?

 * A * It's a bit tricky for now :
       there are 15 user definable configurations, so that you can define
       one for solo use, one for solo use for a friend, and some for
       different multi players setting.
       You can toggle from one to another with the .INI variable 'config'.
       The config number 0 can't be redefined and correspond to the default
       setting for 1 player with default keys in the documentation.

       Each key setting must be placed in the appropriate section. e.g. if you
       want to redefine config number 5, you'll place the definition after
       the marker : [config5] but before any other section marker.

       In the appropriate section, you'll have to place two kind of information.
       First, you'll need to tell the emu what input each player will use.
       e.g. you can tell Hu-Go! that the first player will use the first plugged
       joypad typing 'input1=joy1', the second player can use the second key setting
       with 'input2=key2'

       You can use up to 5 inputs, but only 4 are implemented until now (which
       is not so bad).

       As for the available devices, you now have 5 key setting from 'key1' to
       'key5' and 4 joypads from 'joy1' to 'joy4'. And mice and synaptic links
       should be implemented.

       One you've told what device will be used for each player you want to play
       you can configure more or less each device.

       To configure third key setting for example, use
       UP3=???
       DOWN3=???
       etc...
       defined position or buttons are :
       UP? , DOWN? , LEFT? , RIGHT? , I? , II? , SELECT? , START? , AUTOI? ,
       AUTOII?

       As for the ???, it's the scancode of the concerned key.
       This is where the scancode.txt is useful, you'll find there the
       correspondance between the key you want to assign and the scancode to
       put after the egual sign.
       Imagine you want to assign the up direction of the third key setting
       to the 'O' key on your keyboard.
       You open the scancode.txt and look out for 'O' and find its scancode
       is 0X18 then you put in the right section in the .INI file :

       UP3=0X18

       That's all, easy no ?
       hmm, not really but it'll become so.

       As for the joypad setting, you can only change SELECT, START, AUTOI and
       AUTOII. Using the same key of numbering as the key mapping one.
       This will prevent you from having one player using 'key2' device and another
       'joy2' device, unless you want them to have SELECT, START, AUTOI and AUTOII
       key identical.
