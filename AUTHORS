Hu-Go! authors
==============

Hu-Go! is based on fpce, a pc engine emulator made by Bero.
Improvements done in Xpce, from Hmmx, were also integrated.

Work had then been resumed by Zeograd with the help (in no special order) of :
- David Shadoff (new kernel code, ideas, ...)
- Nyef (cd emulation, ...)
- Ixion (linux coding, sdl joypad, cd emulation, sound emulation, ...)
- Black- (gfx bug fixes, gp32 port, ...)
- Cleaner (freeBSD port fixes)
- Pit (gfx)
- David Michel (ideas, ...)
- Lester Barrow (linux coding, joypad support, ...)
- Mooz (ideas, ...)
- Bt Garner (ideas, ...)
- Zoop & his gf (gfx bug fixes)

Tests by :
- Raph
- Fagemul
- NaMco
- Fixo
- sALTY
- Gato
- Nostromo
- Cissou
- Leeloo
- Sir Jaguar

I probably forgot some people, don't hesitate to contact me so that I can fix this.
